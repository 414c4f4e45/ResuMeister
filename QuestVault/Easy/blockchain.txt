Q: What is blockchain?

A: Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that records transactions in a secure, immutable, and transparent manner. Each block contains a list of transactions, and once a block is completed, it is added to the chain of previous blocks, forming a continuous and unalterable record.

Q: How does blockchain ensure security?

A: Blockchain ensures security through cryptographic techniques, decentralization, and consensus mechanisms. Each transaction is encrypted and linked to the previous one, making it nearly impossible to alter past data without altering all subsequent blocks, which would require the consensus of the majority of the network participants.

Q: What is a decentralized ledger?

A: A decentralized ledger is a database that is consensually shared, replicated, and synchronized across multiple sites, institutions, or geographies. It allows transactions to have public "witnesses," thereby making it more difficult to manipulate or tamper with.

Q: What is a block in blockchain?

A: A block in blockchain is a container data structure that stores a list of transactions, a timestamp, and a reference to the previous block, forming a chain. Each block contains a unique hash, which ensures data integrity and security.

Q: What is a hash in blockchain?

A: A hash in blockchain is a unique identifier for a block, created using a cryptographic hash function. It ensures the integrity of the data within the block by producing a fixed-size string of characters that changes completely if the block data is altered.

Q: What is a node in blockchain?

A: A node in blockchain is a computer that participates in the blockchain network by validating and relaying transactions and maintaining a copy of the entire blockchain. Nodes can be full nodes, which store a complete copy of the blockchain, or lightweight nodes, which store only part of it.

Q: What is a blockchain consensus mechanism?

A: A blockchain consensus mechanism is a protocol used to achieve agreement on a single data value among distributed processes or systems.
