Q: What is Kotlin?
A: Kotlin is a statically typed programming language developed by JetBrains that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It is designed to be fully interoperable with Java and provides modern language features like null safety, extension functions, and data classes to enhance productivity and code safety.

Q: How does Kotlin differ from Java?
A: Kotlin offers several enhancements over Java, such as null safety to avoid null pointer exceptions, concise syntax for data classes and properties, extension functions to add new functionality to existing classes, and support for functional programming with higher-order functions.

Q: What are Kotlin data classes?
A: Data classes in Kotlin are a special class type that automatically generates utility functions like toString(), equals(), hashCode(), and copy() based on the properties defined in the class. They are used to hold and manage immutable data.

Q: What is an extension function in Kotlin?
A: Extension functions in Kotlin allow developers to add new methods to existing classes without modifying their source code. They are defined outside the class and can be called as if they were part of the class, improving code readability and reusability.

Q: What is the purpose of the val keyword in Kotlin?
A: The val keyword in Kotlin is used to declare read-only properties or variables. Once assigned, a val cannot be reassigned, ensuring immutability. It is similar to declaring a final variable in Java.

Q: What is the purpose of the var keyword in Kotlin?
A: The var keyword in Kotlin is used to declare mutable properties or variables. Unlike val, a var can be reassigned with new values, allowing for changes to the variable's state throughout its lifetime.

Q: What is null safety in Kotlin?
A: Null safety in Kotlin is a feature designed to eliminate null pointer exceptions by distinguishing between nullable and non-nullable types. Non-nullable types cannot hold null values, and nullable types must be explicitly declared with a ? to handle nulls safely.

Q: How do you declare a nullable variable in Kotlin?
A: To declare a nullable variable in Kotlin, you append a ? to the type. For example, var name: String? = null declares a variable name that can hold either a String value or null.

Q: What is a data class in Kotlin?
A: A data class in Kotlin is a class specifically designed to hold data. It automatically provides implementations for equals(), hashCode(), toString(), and copy() methods based on the properties declared in the class.

Q: How does Kotlin handle default arguments in functions?
A: Kotlin allows functions to have default values for parameters, enabling callers to omit arguments when calling the function. Default arguments are specified in the function definition and used when no argument is provided for that parameter.

Q: What is a companion object in Kotlin?
A: A companion object in Kotlin is a singleton object that is declared within a class and can be accessed through the class itself. It is used to define static members and methods in a Kotlin class, similar to static methods in Java.

Q: What are sealed classes in Kotlin?
A: Sealed classes in Kotlin are a type of class that restricts class hierarchies to a limited set of types known at compile time. They are used to represent a fixed set of possible types and are commonly used in conjunction with when expressions for type-safe handling.

Q: What is the when expression in Kotlin?
A: The when expression in Kotlin is a versatile control flow statement that allows for handling multiple conditions in a cleaner and more readable manner compared to traditional switch statements. It can be used as an expression or statement.

Q: How does Kotlin handle string interpolation?
A: Kotlin supports string interpolation, allowing variables and expressions to be embedded within string literals using the ${} syntax. This makes string manipulation and formatting more concise and readable.

Q: What is the lateinit keyword in Kotlin?
A: The lateinit keyword in Kotlin is used to declare a property that will be initialized later, avoiding the need for an immediate initialization. It is typically used with mutable properties that cannot be initialized in the constructor.

A: A suspend function in Kotlin is a special type of function that can be paused and resumed, allowing for asynchronous programming. It is used with Kotlin's coroutines to perform tasks like network requests or long-running operations without blocking the main thread.

Q: How does Kotlin handle inheritance?
A: Kotlin supports single inheritance, where a class can inherit from one superclass. To allow a class to be inherited from, the class must be marked with the open keyword, and methods must also be open to be overridden by subclasses.

Q: What is a data class used for in Kotlin?
A: A data class in Kotlin is used for holding data with automatically generated methods such as toString(), equals(), hashCode(), and copy(). It simplifies the creation of classes whose primary purpose is to store values.

Q: How do you handle exceptions in Kotlin?
A: Exceptions in Kotlin are handled using try, catch, and finally blocks. The try block contains the code that might throw an exception, the catch block handles specific exceptions, and the finally block executes code regardless of whether an exception occurred.

Q: What are inline functions in Kotlin?
A: Inline functions in Kotlin are functions that are expanded at the call site rather than being called normally. They help reduce the overhead of function calls, especially when using lambda expressions, and improve performance.

Q: What is the difference between let, run, and apply in Kotlin?
A: let, run, and apply are scope functions in Kotlin with different purposes. let allows performing operations on the result of an expression and returns the result. run combines let and with, executing a block of code and returning the result. apply allows configuring an object and returns the object itself.

Q: What is the with function in Kotlin?
A: The with function in Kotlin is used to call multiple methods on the same object within a block of code, improving readability. It takes the object as an argument and allows accessing its methods and properties without repeating the object's reference.

Q: What is the as keyword used for in Kotlin?
A: The as keyword in Kotlin is used for type casting. It allows you to cast an object to a specific type, either with a safe cast as? that returns null if the cast fails, or with a non-nullable cast as that throws an exception if the cast fails.

Q: What is the typealias keyword in Kotlin?
A: The typealias keyword in Kotlin creates an alias for an existing type, simplifying complex type definitions or providing more descriptive names. It does not create a new type but offers an alternative name for an existing type.
