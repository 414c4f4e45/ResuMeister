Q: What is Java?
A: Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to be platform-independent. It follows the principle of "write once, run anywhere," meaning that Java code can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.

Q: What is polymorphism in Java?
A: Polymorphism in Java is the ability of a single method or operator to work in different ways depending on the object or data type. It allows methods to have the same name but different implementations, and enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.

Q: What is encapsulation in Java?
A: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, providing a way to protect the data and control how it is accessed or modified.

Q: What is abstraction in Java?
A: Abstraction in Java is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It allows developers to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it, typically achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.

Q: What is an interface in Java?
A: An interface in Java is a reference type that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types. Interfaces specify a set of methods that a class must implement, allowing for multiple inheritance of behavior and providing a way to achieve abstraction.

The Callable interface, on the other hand, defines a call method that returns a result and can throw checked exceptions.

Q: What is the volatile keyword in Java?
A: The volatile keyword in Java is used to indicate that a variable's value will be modified by different threads. It ensures that changes to the variable are visible to all threads immediately and prevents caching of the variable's value.
