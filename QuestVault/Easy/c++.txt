Q: What is C++?
A: C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that extends the C programming language by adding object-oriented features, such as classes and inheritance. It allows for both low-level memory manipulation and high-level abstractions, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from system software to game development.

Q: What are the basic data types in C++?
A: The basic data types in C++ include int for integers, float for single-precision floating-point numbers, double for double-precision floating-point numbers, char for characters, and bool for boolean values. These types are used to define variables and manipulate data in C++ programs.

Q: What is a class in C++?
A: A class in C++ is a user-defined data type that represents a blueprint for creating objects. It encapsulates data members (variables) and member functions (methods) that operate on the data. Classes are fundamental to object-oriented programming, allowing for the creation of reusable and modular code.

Q: What is an object in C++?
A: An object in C++ is an instance of a class. It represents a specific realization of the class and has its own unique state and behavior based on the class definition. Objects interact with each other by calling methods and accessing data members defined in their class.

Q: What is inheritance in C++?
A: Inheritance in C++ is a mechanism that allows a new class (derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (base class). It promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes, where the derived class can extend or override the base class's functionality.

Q: What is polymorphism in C++?
A: Polymorphism in C++ is a concept that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It enables methods to be called on objects of different derived classes through a base class pointer or reference, allowing for dynamic method resolution and code flexibility.

Q: What is encapsulation in C++?
A: Encapsulation in C++ is the practice of bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a class and restricting access to some of the object's components. It helps protect the internal state of the object from unintended interference and misuse, promoting modularity and maintainability.

Q: What is abstraction in C++?
A: Abstraction in C++ is the concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. It allows developers to focus on high-level functionalities while concealing low-level details, making the code easier to understand and manage.

Q: What is the difference between struct and class in C++?
A: In C++, both struct and class are used to define custom data types. The main difference is that members of a struct are public by default, while members of a class are private by default. Both struct and class support encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Q: What are access specifiers in C++?
A: Access specifiers in C++ are keywords that define the visibility of class members. The three primary access specifiers are public, protected, and private. Public members are accessible from outside the class, protected members are accessible only within the class and its derived classes, and private members are accessible only within the class.

Q: What is a virtual function in C++?
A: A virtual function in C++ is a member function declared with the virtual keyword in a base class.

Q: What is a pure virtual function in C++?
A: A pure virtual function in C++ is a virtual function that is declared with the = 0 syntax in a base class. It does not have an implementation in the base class and must be overridden by derived classes. A class containing pure virtual functions is considered an abstract class and cannot be instantiated directly.

Q: What is a static member in C++?
