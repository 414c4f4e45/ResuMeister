Q: What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning in machine learning?
A: Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, meaning each training example is paired with an output label. The model learns to map inputs to the correct output based on this data. In contrast, unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data. The model tries to identify patterns, such as clustering similar data points together or finding hidden structures in the data without any predefined labels.

Q: What is the purpose of dropout in neural networks?
A: Dropout is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting in neural networks. During training, dropout randomly deactivates a fraction of neurons in each layer at each iteration. This forces the network to learn more robust features that are not reliant on specific neurons, which improves generalization and reduces the risk of overfitting to the training data.

Q: How does a convolutional neural network (CNN) work?
A: A CNN is designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images. It uses convolutional layers to apply filters (kernels) that slide over the image to detect patterns like edges and textures. These features are then pooled to reduce dimensionality, and fully connected layers at the end make the final classification or prediction based on the extracted features.

Q: What is the Vanishing Gradient Problem?
A: The Vanishing Gradient Problem occurs in deep neural networks when gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights become very small as they are propagated backward through the network.
