{"question": "What is a neural network's kernel?", "answer": "A kernel, or filter, is a small matrix used in convolutional layers to detect specific patterns or features in the input data. It slides over the input to perform convolution operations."}
{"question": "What is a neural network's fully connected layer?", "answer": "A fully connected layer, also known as a dense layer, is a type of layer where each neuron is connected to every neuron in the previous layer. It is used for combining features learned by previous layers and making final predictions."}
{"question": "What is a neural network's activation function?", "answer": "An activation function is a mathematical function applied to the output of a neuron to introduce non-linearity into the network. It helps the network learn complex patterns and relationships in the data."}
{"question": "What is a neural network's dropout layer?", "answer": "A dropout layer randomly deactivates a fraction of neurons during training to prevent overfitting. It forces the network to rely on different subsets of neurons, improving generalization."}
{"question": "What is a neural network's gradient descent?", "answer": "Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function by iteratively adjusting the model's weights in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss."}
{"question": "What is a neural network's mini-batch gradient descent?", "answer": "Mini-batch gradient descent is an optimization technique that uses a small subset (mini-batch) of the training data to update the model's weights. It combines the advantages of both batch and stochastic gradient descent."}
