{"question": "What is Java?", "answer": "Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems. It is designed to be platform-independent, meaning that code written in Java can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM)."}
{"question": "What is the JVM?", "answer": "The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is an engine that provides a runtime environment to execute Java bytecode. It allows Java programs to be platform-independent by translating bytecode into machine-specific code."}
{"question": "What are the main features of Java?", "answer": "The main features of Java include portability, object-oriented programming, platform independence, security, and robustness."}
{"question": "What is a Java class?", "answer": "A Java class is a blueprint from which individual objects are created. It defines a type of object by bundling data and methods that operate on the data."}
{"question": "What is the difference between a class and an object in Java?", "answer": "A class is a blueprint that defines the properties and behaviors of objects, whereas an object is an instance of a class, representing a specific entity with actual values."}
{"question": "What is inheritance in Java?", "answer": "Inheritance is a mechanism where one class (the child class) inherits properties and methods from another class (the parent class). It promotes code reuse and establishes a natural hierarchy."}
{"question": "What is polymorphism in Java?", "answer": "Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. It enables one interface to be used for a general class of actions and allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon."}
{"question": "What is encapsulation in Java?", "answer": "Encapsulation is the practice of wrapping the data (variables) and code (methods) together as a single unit and restricting direct access to some of an object's components. This is achieved using access modifiers like private, protected, and public."}
{"question": "What is abstraction in Java?", "answer": "Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It can be achieved using abstract classes and interfaces."}
{"question": "What is an abstract class?", "answer": "An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to be subclassed. It can have abstract methods (without implementation) as well as concrete methods (with implementation)."}
{"question": "What is an interface in Java?", "answer": "An interface is a reference type in Java that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types. Interfaces define a contract that implementing classes must follow."}
{"question": "How does Java achieve platform independence?", "answer": "Java achieves platform independence through the use of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java code is compiled into bytecode, which is then executed by the JVM on any platform."}
{"question": "What are Java access modifiers?", "answer": "Java access modifiers control the visibility of classes, methods, and variables. The primary access modifiers are public, protected, private, and the default (package-private) access level."}
{"question": "What is the static keyword used for in Java?", "answer": "The static keyword is used to declare class-level members (variables or methods) that belong to the class itself rather than instances of the class. Static members can be accessed without creating an instance of the class."}
{"question": "What is the difference between == and equals() in Java?", "answer": "== is a reference comparison operator that checks if two references point to the same object in memory, while equals() is a method that checks if two objects are logically equal based on their content."}
{"question": "What is method overloading?", "answer": "Method overloading occurs when multiple methods in a class have the same name but different parameters (different type, number, or both). It allows methods to perform similar but distinct functions."}
{"question": "What is method overriding?", "answer": "Method overriding is when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. The method in the subclass must have the same name, return type, and parameters."}
{"question": "What is the difference between an interface and an abstract class?", "answer": "An interface can only declare methods without implementation (until Java 8 introduced default methods), while an abstract class can provide both abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation). Interfaces are more flexible for multiple inheritance, while abstract classes are useful for sharing code among related classes."}

{"question": "What is the difference between a constructor and a method?", "answer": "Constructors are used to initialize objects and have the same name as the class, while methods are used to define the behavior of an object and can have any name."}
{"question": "What is the final keyword in Java?", "answer": "The final keyword can be used to define constants, prevent method overriding, and prevent inheritance of classes. It can be applied to variables, methods, and classes."}
