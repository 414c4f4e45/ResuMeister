{"question": "What is Go's approach to implementing interfaces?", "answer": "Interfaces in Go are implemented implicitly, meaning a type satisfies an interface if it has the methods required by the interface."}
{"question": "How do you define an interface in Go?", "answer": "An interface is defined using the type keyword followed by the interface keyword, specifying the methods that must be implemented."}
{"question": "How do you implement an interface in Go?", "answer": "An interface is implemented by defining methods on a type that match the methods required by the interface."}
