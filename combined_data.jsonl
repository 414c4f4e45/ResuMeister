{"question": "What is RAG in machine learning?", "answer": "RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is a technique that combines information retrieval and text generation. It retrieves relevant documents from a database and uses them to generate a more accurate and context-aware response.", "context": "rag"}
{"question": "How does RAG work?", "answer": "RAG works by first retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge base using a retriever model.

{"question": "What are the components of a RAG model?", "answer": "A RAG model typically consists of two main components: a retriever model, which identifies relevant documents, and a generator model, which produces the final output based on the retrieved documents.", "context": "rag"}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the retriever in RAG?", "answer": "The retriever in RAG is responsible for searching a knowledge base or document corpus to find the most relevant documents or passages that can inform the generation process.", "context": "rag"}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the generator in RAG?", "answer": "The generator in RAG uses the retrieved documents to generate a response or text that is contextually accurate and relevant to the input query.", "context": "rag"}
